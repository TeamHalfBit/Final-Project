**Describe your game:** "The game will be a top down shooter. The character is stuck in a fenced field and is in an armored vehicle, and they are getting surrounded by the Jabinx, a group of alien bug lifeforms that invaded earth. Their only weakness is water, and the tank shoots water missiles at the aliens. 

The aliens, in an attempt to find better ways to defeat you, drop boxes with new weapons to try and eliminate you. However, they don't know how to open the boxes. But your tank can accept new upgrades. Running the boxes over will give you an upgrade for a limited amount of time.

There will be enemies of different difficulties, and then a boss character. The enemies will follow you at different speeds, and can do a certain amount of damage. Can you survive?"
